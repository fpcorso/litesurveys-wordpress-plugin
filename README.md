# LiteSurveys WordPress Plugin

This plugin connects your [LiteSurveys](https://litesurveys.com) account to your WordPress site. It allows you to easily embed surveys into your site and collect responses.

**Important Note**: This plugin requires a LiteSurveys plan to create surveys and collect responses. Get started for free today!.

## Getting Started

We do not currently use any build scripts. This repo can be downloaded as a zip and installed as-is as a WordPress plugin.

Once installed, there will be a new **LiteSurveys** page added to the Settings menu where you can add your website ID from your LiteSurveys account.
